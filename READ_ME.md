For this project I implemented a doubly linked list to make a Jukebox App (or it least the back of one)
I used a node structure with a next and previous pointer, as well as data in the form of the title of a song, and it's playlist
I tried to model this project after the homeworks from this semester so you should be able to cmake and run_tests on this data structure.
You should be able to see from the tests, but I was able to get song anf playlist movement, as well as putting in a loop option that allows for infinite playing. I did this by making it a looped doubly linked list.
I also wanted to make a function to move playlists, but I was not able to get it working in time, however I have left my attempt, as well as the test it fails.
